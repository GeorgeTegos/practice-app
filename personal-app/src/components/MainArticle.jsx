      <h1>Harry Potter Introduction </h1>

      <p>
        A fictional character, Harry Potter is the boy wizard created by British
        author J.K. Rowling. His coming-of-age exploits were the subject of
        seven enormously popular novels. The novels were adapted into eight
        blockbuster films (the final book was adapted into two films) that
        debuted between 2001 and 2011. A play and a book of its script, Harry
        Potter and the Cursed Child, appeared in 2016.

        The Harry Potter series was extremely popular with both children and
        adults worldwide. All the books were best sellers, available in more
        than 200 countries and some 60 languages. The phenomenon introduced new
        terms into common usage. For example, muggle became popular as a word
        for a person who possesses no magical powers. The series of eight films
        made stars of such actors as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma
        Watson. Together, the book and movie series spawned a huge amount of
        related merchandise. Beginning in 2010 Harry Potter attractions opened
        at Universal Studios theme parks in the United States and Japan.
